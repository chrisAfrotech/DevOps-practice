*************Master docker(inspired by mosh Hamedani tutorial on docker for bigginer)********************


******************What is docker********************
Docker is a platform for building, running and shipping apllications in a consistent manner.


****************Virtual machine vs container********
Container: is an isolated environment for running an application 
Virtual machine is an abstraction of a machine(Physical hardware)"using hypervisors(vmware, virtualbox)"

********Architecture of docker**********************
it use client server architecture
server is call Docker engine  

linux(linux container)
windows(windows and linux container)
Mac(linux virtualmachine to run linux container)

****************Installing docker*******************
   linux: sudo apt-get install docker.io

*****************Development workflow***************
	-Add dockerfile in the application to dockerise it!
	-push the image file to the remote docker registery as docker hub
	-pull it on any machine running docker for test and production

******************Docker action**********************
if we use normal method ou were suppose to:
-start with an os
-install node
-copy app files
-run node app.js

But with using docker you wil package your application
-open your directory
-add "Dockerfile"
-configure it: 
	FROM node:alpine
	copy . /app
	WORKDIR /app
	CMD node app.js

-docker build -t hello-docker: in terminal to compile the app for production
-docker image ls :to see the respository
-Running on docker loacl machine: docker run hello-docker
-add it to docker registery (docker hub)
-pull it on the test or developement machine and run it

 
**************Docker for ubuntu******************
whoami: to know the type of user is active at the moment
docker ps : to see the docker container started
docker ps -a: to see stopped docker container files
docker run it ubuntu: to run and start container with ubuntu
