***********************what is agile?*******************
  Agile is a set of methods and practices that focuses on iterative development 

Advantages of using agile methodology:
	-project follow a predifined schedule and have a predictable cost
	-clients have visibility of esch phase of the project
	-create interaction between the project team and the project
	-Product output is predictable and can something happen earlier than expected
	-high quality development testing and collaboration is ensured since the project broken down
	-The product backlog can be refined and reprioritized
	-The teams can maximize project value since clients can privide project priority
	-The needs of the customers can be focused on, increasing the value delivred

 Agile methodologies:
 	-SCRUM (the most used)
 	-kanban
 	-xp	
 	-lean 
 	-crystal

******************What is scrum?**************************
 Scrum is a framework that enables teams to work together

Benefit of using scrum:
	-Teams can provide project deliverables in an efficient manner
	-times and money are used efficiently
	-Project are delivered into smaller units call sprints
	-Work best for fast moving projects
	-scrum meetings provide the team great visibility
	-Constantly involves feedback from clients and customers
	-Making changes based on feedback are very easy
	-Individual efforts of the team members are given focus


Scrum TEAM: it involves 3 roles
	-Product owner: 
		Determining the product features prioritizing it into a list, what need to be focused on for the next sprint and constantly reprioritizing it and refining it 

	-Scrum master:
		Helpsteams learn and apply scrum to obtain business value. helps remove impediments,protect team from interference and helps to adopt agile practice

	-Scrum team:
		Collection of individuals that work together to deliver the requirements of the stakeholders



Scrum ARTIFACTS (they are 3)
	The are components of the srum process that can improve transparency and understanding of the work.
	-Product Backlog
		*New features
		*changes to made to existing features
		*Bug fixes
		*Changes to the infrastructure and several other activities team needs to deliver to ensure particular outcome

	-Sprint Backlog(subset of product backlog)
		* Sprint refers to short period of time during which a scrum team aims to get amount of work done		

		* contains task that the team aims to complete to satisfy the sprint goal(objective decided for the sprint as an outcome between prod owner and team)

	-Product increment
		Is  the combination of all product backlog tasks completed in a sprint and the value of increments of previous sprints

Product backlog: list of tasks to succesfully achieve the goal of the stakeholders

Sprint plannig: team determines the tasks from product catalog they will work on and deliver during the sprint

Sprint backlog:  tasks dicussing during script planning are then added to sprint backlog 

Scrum team: (usualy of 5 to 9 members) work on the task in the sprint backlog
 
Daily scrum:sessions of 15 minutes generally where the teams synchronize activities and plan what they achieve in the next 24hours

Sprint review: it takes place after the sprint is completed. It involves the team, scrum master, product owner and stakeholders.


increment: workable output is given to the stakeholders

*****************Scrum Board********************
it is a physical or virtual tool that helps team to visualize items in the sprint backlog
